Domain: Number Guessing Game (Java)

Project Title
Number Guessing Game using Java (GUI Based)-Task 2

# Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a **Number Guessing Game** using Java where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts. The project helps in understanding Java programming logic, control statements, random number generation, and GUI development.

# Project Description

This project is a fun and interactive **Java Swing-based Number Guessing Game**.
The system generates a random number, and the user has a fixed number of attempts to guess it correctly.
After each guess, the application provides feedback such as “Too High”, “Too Low”, or “Correct Guess”.
The game may include multiple rounds and score tracking.

# Features

*  Random number generation
*  User input through GUI
*  Hint for **Too High** guesses
*  Hint for **Too Low** guesses
*  Limited attempts per round
*  Multiple rounds support
*  Score calculation
*  Interactive GUI using Java Swing
  
# Tools & Technologies Used

* Programming Language: Java
* GUI Framework: Java Swing & AWT
* IDE: VS Code 
* JDK Version: JDK 8 or above
* Platform: Windows

# Steps Performed

1. Generated a random number using `Random` class.
2. Designed the GUI using Java Swing components.
3. Accepted user input through text fields.
4. Compared user guess with generated number.
5. Displayed hints like **Too High / Too Low**.
6. Reduced attempts after each guess.
7. Implemented score calculation and round management.
8. Tested the game for different inputs.

# Outcome

* Successfully created a GUI-based Number Guessing Game.
* Improved understanding of Java Swing, event handling, and logical programming.
* Learned how to manage attempts, rounds, and user interaction in a real-time application.
